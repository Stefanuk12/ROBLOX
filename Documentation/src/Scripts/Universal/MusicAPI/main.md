# Music API

If you wish to check out the Music Table then go to this [link](https://stefanuk12.github.io/ROBLOX/Universal/Music%20API/Web%20Version/index.html). 
**Please note these are not automatically updated as soon as an audio is removed, instead it is removed manually as I don't know how to automate it in JS**
